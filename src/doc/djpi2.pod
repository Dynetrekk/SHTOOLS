=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<djpi2> will calculate the rotation matrix d_{mM}^j (pi/2) that is used in rotating spherical harmonics in the routines I<SHRotateRealCoef> and I<SHRotateCoef>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 10

=item DJ

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION (LMAX+1, LMAX+1, LMAX+1)

The rotation matrix dj(pi/2).
	
=item LMAX

(input) INTEGER

The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the spherical harmonic rotation.

=head1 NOTES

This routine is based on code originally written by Guy Masters, subsequently modified by Mark Simons, and finally turned into f95 code by myself. There was no documentation with the original code, and it is not immediately obvious to me as to how the matrix is ordered. If you understand this, please let me know!
