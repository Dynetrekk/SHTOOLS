=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Hilm> is used to iteratively solve for the relief along an interface that corresponds to a given Bouguer anomaly. This is equation 18 of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998) which implicitly takes into consideration the finite-amplitude correction. Each iteration takes as input a guess for the relief (expanded on a Gauss-Legendre grid) and outputs the iteratively improved spherical harmonic coefficients of the relief. These coefficients can then be expanded on a Gauss-Legendre grid (using MakeGridGLQ) and re-input into this routine as the next guess. For the initial guess, it is often sufficient to use the relief predicted using the first-order "mass sheet" approximation, or perhaps zero. If the algorithm does not converge, one might want to try damping the initial estimate.

It is important to understand that as an intermediate step, this routine calculates the spherical harmonic coefficients of the relief raised to the nth power, i.e., GRIDGLQ**n, using the routine I<CilmPlus>. As such, if the input function is bandlimited to degree L, the resulting function will thus be bandlimited to degree L*NMAX. This subroutine implicitly assumes that LMAX is greater than or equal to L*NMAX. If this is not the case, then aliasing will occur. In practice, for accurate results, it is found that LMAX needs only to be about twice the size of L, though this should be verified for each application. Thus, if the input function is considered to be bandlimited to degree L, the function should be evaluated on a Gauss-Legendre grid corresponding to a maximum degree of about 2*L.

If memory is not an issue, the algorithm can be speeded up considerably by inputing the optional array PLX of precomputed associated Legendre functions on the Gauss-Legendre nodes. If PLX is not specified, then it is necessary to input the optional array ZERO that contains the latitudinal Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes. Both of these variables are computed by a call to I<PreCompute>.


=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 13

=item CILM 

(output) REAL*8, DIMENSION (2, LMAX+1, LMAX+1)

An estimate of the real spherical harmonic coefficients (geodesy normalized) of relief along an interface with density contrast RHO that satisfies the Bouguer anomaly BA. The degree zero term corresponds to the mean radius of the relief.

=item BA

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (2, LMAX+1, LMAX+1)

The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the Bouguer anomaly referenced to a spherical interface R0.

=item GRIDGLQ

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (LMAX+1, 2*LMAX+1)

The initial estimate for the radii of the interface evaluated on the Gauss-Legendre grid points corresponding to a function of maximum spherical harmonic degree LMAX. This is calculated by a call to I<MakeGridGLQ>. This grid must contain the degree-0 average radius of the interface.
	
=item LMAX

(input) INTEGER

The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the output spherical harmonic coefficients for the relief and the input spherical harmonics for the Bouguer anomaly. This degree also determines the dimension of the gridded input relief GRIDGLQ. As a general rule, this should be about twice the spherical harmonic bandwidth of the input function.

=item NMAX

(input) INTEGER

The maximum order used in the Taylor-series expansion used in calculating the potential coefficients. As a rule, this should be about 4.
	
=item MASS

(input) REAL*8

The mass of the planet in kg.
	
=item R0

(input) REAL*8

The reference radius of the Bouguer anomaly BA.
	
=item RHO

(input) REAL*8

The density contrast of the relief in kg/m^3.
	
=item W

(input) REAL*8, DIMENSION (LMAX+1)

The weights used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. These are calculated from a call to I<PreCompute> (or alternatively, I<PreGLQ>).

=item PLX

(input) REAL*8, OPTIONAL, DIMENSION (LMAX+1, (LMAX+1)*(LMAX+2)/2)

An array of the associated Legendre functions calculated at the nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. These are determined from a call to I<PreCompute>. Either PLX or ZERO must be present, but not both.
	
=item ZERO

(input) REAL*8, OPTIONAL, DIMENSION (LMAX+1)

The nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature over latitude, calculated by a call to I<PreCompute>.  Either PLX or ZERO must be present, but not both.

=item FILTER_TYPE

(input) INTEGER, OPTIONAL

Apply a filter when calculating the relief in order to minimize the destabilizing effects of downward continuation which amplify uncertainties in the Bouguer anomaly. If 1, use the minimum amplitude filter of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998; equation 19). If 2, use a minimum curvature filter.

=item FILTER_DEG

(input) INTEGER, OPTIONAL

The spherical harmonic degree for which the filter is 0.5.

=head1 NOTES

This routine uses geodesy 4-pi normalized spherical harmonics that exclude the Condon-Shortley phase; This can not be modified.

This routine requires the fast Fourier transform library I<FFTW>, which is available at L<http://www.fftw.org>.
